Ok. So we've split a single commit into a few smaller commits.

What if we want to combine commits instead?

If you run `git log` on this branch, you'll see that I've been quite busy with committing when writing this exercise. I think you'll agree I've gone a bit farâ€¦

There's quite a handy tool for fixing this though. It's called "interactive rebase". Since "interactive rebase" is a bit of a mouthful, and "squash" is the action you'll probably most often use it for, I'll often use the term "squashing" for the whole process of performing an interactive rebase. (Well, OK, you'll probably actually mostly use the "fixup" action, but that's basically the same as "squash" and "fixuping" sounds beyond stupid ðŸ™ˆ)
