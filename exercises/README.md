Ok. So we've split a single commit into a few smaller commits.

What if we want to combine commits instead?

If you run `git log` on this branch, you'll see that I've been quite busy with committing when writing this exercise. I think you'll agree I've gone a bit farâ€¦

There's quite a handy tool for fixing this though. It's called "interactive rebase". Since "interactive rebase" is a bit of a mouthful, and "squash" is the action you'll probably most often use it for, I'll often use the term "squashing" for the whole process of performing an interactive rebase. (Well, OK, you'll probably actually mostly use the "fixup" action, but that's basically the same as "squash" and "fixuping" sounds beyond stupid ðŸ™ˆ)

To run an interactive rebase, run `git rebase -i <starting point>`.

As you can see, you need to supply a starting point. This starting point is the last commit you *don't* want to include. This might seem counter-intuitive, but remember that we are performing a *rebase*. We take everything after the given commit, change it to our liking, and "rebase" it onto the given commit.

Run `git log` and find the commit called "feat(exercises): add exercise on squashing commits". Then copy the hash of the commit just *before* that (i.e. the first *older* commit).

Now run `git rebase -i <hash>`.

You'll get a text file with all the commits listed in order, with the oldest one first. Below them is a comment explaining some of the commands you can use to squash, remove, or edit the different commits.

The commit that adds the section about amending is a large-ish one, and I think it can be reasonable to keep that as its own separate commit. But I suggest squashing all the other commits into the first one.

Now it's time to look at the exercise for "cherry-picking". See you there!
